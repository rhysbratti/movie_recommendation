# Movie Recommendation Engine
## Powered by the TMDB API - written in Rust and the Actix Web framework

This is the back end of an ongoing side project of mine to build a movie recommendation service with the help of the TMDB API! It is to be paired with a React front end that is in very active development (as I have never used React!). 

The idea behind this service is to help users find movie recommendations that are available on their streaming services based on criteria like genre, movie length, decade, etc.
